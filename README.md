# üî• Firefly Algorithm ‚Äì Exam Scheduling Project

This project implements the **Firefly Algorithm** using **C++** to solve a real-world **Exam Scheduling Problem**. The goal is to assign exams to available time slots in a way that **minimizes conflicts** for students who have multiple exams. This project is developed as part of the **Analysis of Algorithm** course and is aligned with **Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)** and **Seoul Accord attributes**.

- Each firefly represents one possible exam schedule  
- Objective function minimizes student exam conflicts  
- Fireflies move based on attraction and random exploration  
- Shows output per run with:
  - Best exam-to-timeslot assignments  
  - Total number of student conflicts  
  - Execution time in milliseconds  
  - Estimated memory usage
